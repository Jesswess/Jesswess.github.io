  <p>
    Overfishing leads to many species if fish being. One example of this is how sharks are being hunted for their fins, simply to make soup. Their fins are cut off and they may even be thrown back into the ocean to die slowly. Humans overfish the oceans so much that at some point fish stop showing up and restrictions must be placed. When the fish stop showing up, the people who actually need fish for food don’t have any. Some of these fish are even needed for other fish to have food, which means we are endangering more fish by starving them. It wouldn’t have to get to the point of fish being endangered if people would just fish for need instead of in excess. This poster shows this overfishing problem by having shark fins across the background and showing how they are steadily being crossed out until there are none left. The fish hook also emphasizes that it’s overfishing by humans causing this problem.
