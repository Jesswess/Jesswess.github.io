<h1>Philosophical Quandaries</h1>
<h2>Outdated Phrases</h2>
<p>
  If something is strange it's out of whack. Though if you use that word, it's considered whack. Not only the word, but you're whack for saying the word. The act of saying the word is whack in itself. I don't know how a word can be considered wack or uncool. Some are uncool just because they sound weird to say. Like mommy. If you say mommy as a grown man, you're going to get laughed at even though it's literally just a synonym for mother. Why is that? Is it just because it seems childish to say. Well the only reason it's childish to say is because we tell children to say it. Which also happens to be a reason that it's such a hard habit to break, when you come of age. The age where it is socially unnacceptable for you to say mommy or daddy. In fact, I'm embarrassed saying it to myself.
  Some words are outdated and that's why they're considered whack to say. Like groovy. If you went around saying groovy, you'd get kicked in your nuts.

  <h2>Honors Classes in Broward</h2>
	<p>
  I'm starting to think all honors classes are horrible. Like every honors class I'm in, it seems like I'm learning no more than the regular classes, in fact I feel like we're learning less. Cause while in normal classes, a lot of class time may be taken up by disrupting kids and having to go over the same stuff because people don't understand it after the last 3 classes of reviews, honors classes prefer to waste your time instead. If you could take the hours that I spent literally sitting at my desk doing jack shit in honors history or honors english and put them into service hours, I wouldn't even need service hours. I'd have enough to get a scholarship. Instead because the teacher doesn't have any plan for us, thee make us sit there for 20 minutes while they take attendence and possibly do thier taxes, then they walk around the class and give a 30 minute long ass boring ass lecture, which is basically just repeating everything we could have read in the book, then they assign some pages in the book for us to copy verbatum and tell us to get to it. Like if you were gonna make me read the textbook anyway, why give me this long ass boring ass lecture. I mean jesus christ. And they think I want to sit in class doing my homework. Instead of sitting in class trying to do my homework I could be going home and doing my homework. Instead we need hour and a half long classes that aren't fun whatsoever. The worst part is when you have a teacher that doesn't want to let you use the bathroom. Like, this class is an hour long and a guy can't use the bathroom. What am I missing? We're literally sitting in class for the next hour doin homework that we could be doing at home, but yet I can't go to the bathroom. Miss me with that... And what makes that even worse is that everyone in honors classes are so quiet and polite, like up to my last day in honors history I don't think my teacher had to shush someone once. People raised their hands to answer questions once a week and nobody ever raised their hand to read. You could hear a pen drop, you could hear a fart grumbling in someone's stomach, you could hear a dog whistle. But back to the work. Even the work is only slightly harder than regular classes, that is when you even get work. All I know is in my experience I've gotten more assignments and less time to do assignments in regular classes than in any honors class I've taken. If honors was supposed to prepare me for college, I feel like they failed cuase they certainly didn't prepare me for college algebra. So you got easy work, more time, long periods of nothing in classrooms full of quietness; if there is one way I had to describe honors classes it would be boring as hell and unnecessary. Just a class full of well behaved kids, aside from that there's not much more honorable about it
