Jesse Smith’s first job was as an art organizer. Being a sea creature, he wanted to paint his homeland, the place where he came from. The depths of the ocean. Thus, instead of doing as he was contracted to do, he just painted a bunch of sea creatures on the wall of a kindergarten. Now you know why he no longer works there.

There was another job he was contracted to do; it involved setting up activities for a youth council. As you can see, he constructed some musical apparatus out of ceramic tubes as he is not yet accustomed to the materials of land animals. He was quickly let go after this incident too. He hasn’t had much luck since, but he has spent some time working as a Walmart cashier. He got fired after showing up late too many times. The lateness wasn’t the problem, the excuse was. He had to feed his fish.

In addition to work, Jesse also went to school full time. His schedule sometimes left him with 5 hours of sleep before he went back to work. Jesse was not sad when he got fired from all these jobs. After all, he got to meet so many wonderful people, he even met his current girlfriend at his workplace. Isn’t that serendipitous.
